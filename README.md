> Improved waiting time for the adidas.com splash page.

This is a script for people who don't want to deal with proxies for brute forcing the adidas.com splash page. There are a few similar scripts out there already, but this uses completely separate Chrome sessions for improved results. It is pretty heavy on the CPU though.

# Setup

### 1. Download and unzip.

   [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bequadro/kju/total.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/bequadro/kju/releases/latest)

### 2. Install Node.js.

   Download it form [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/). Or do yourself a favor and use a package manager: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for macOS and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) for Windows.

   If you're feeling fancy, install and use Yarn instead of NPM.

### 3. Setup kju.

   Open your terminal and `cd` to the `kju` folder. Install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

   In the meantime, log into your Google account on Chrome and export all your cookies with the [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) extensions into a file called `cookie.json` in the `kju` folder.

   Open `config.js` and edit it to your liking.
